File::FDkeeper - Store open filehandles in another process for later use
========================================================================

File::FDkeeper allows you to store open filehandles in a "server" process and
retrieve them at a later time from another process.

When a filehandle is stored, an id is returned. This id can then be used by 
any other process to retrieve the filehandle (as long as they have permission 
to open the fifo).
